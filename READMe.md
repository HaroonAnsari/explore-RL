# explore-RL
This repository serves as an essential guide to the field of Reinforcement Learning (RL), offering a curated list of both foundational and recent influential papers. It is divided into two main sections: the first contains the seminal papers that have shaped the foundation of RL, and the second provides a chronological list of key papers that reflect the latest advancements and trends in the field. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or an enthusiast, this collection is designed to keep you up-to-date and deepen your understanding of the ever-evolving landscape of RL.
